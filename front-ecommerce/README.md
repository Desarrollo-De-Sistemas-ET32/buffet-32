# Next.js Commerce

A high-performance, server-rendered Next.js App Router ecommerce application.

This template uses React Server Components, Server Actions, `Suspense`, `useOptimistic`, and more.

## Providers

Vercel will only be actively maintaining a Shopify version [as outlined in our vision and strategy for Next.js Commerce](https://github.com/vercel/commerce/pull/966).

Vercel is happy to partner and work with any commerce provider to help them get a similar template up and running and listed below. Alternative providers should be able to fork this repository and swap out the `lib/shopify` file with their own implementation while leaving the rest of the template mostly unchanged.

## Integrations

Integrations enable upgraded or additional functionality for Next.js Commerce

- [Orama](https://github.com/oramasearch/nextjs-commerce) ([Demo](https://vercel-commerce.oramasearch.com/))

  - Upgrades search to include typeahead with dynamic re-rendering, vector-based similarity search, and JS-based configuration.
  - Search runs entirely in the browser for smaller catalogs or on a CDN for larger.

- [React Bricks](https://github.com/ReactBricks/nextjs-commerce-rb) ([Demo](https://nextjs-commerce.reactbricks.com/))
  - Edit pages, product details, and footer content visually using [React Bricks](https://www.reactbricks.com) visual headless CMS.

## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Next.js Commerce. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control your Shopify store.

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

<details>
  <summary>Expand if you work at Vercel and want to run locally and / or contribute</summary>

1. Run `vc link`.
1. Select the `Vercel Solutions` scope.
1. Connect to the existing `commerce-shopify` project.
1. Run `vc env pull` to get environment variables.
1. Run `pnpm dev` to ensure everything is working correctly.

## Database Management (Drizzle)

This project uses [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) to manage the PostgreSQL database schema and queries.

### Setup

1.  **Get your database connection string** from your provider (e.g., Supabase).
2.  Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project.
3.  Add your connection string to the `.env.local` file:
    ```
    DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:password@host:port/db"
    ```

### Scripts

The following scripts are available for managing the database schema:

-   `pnpm db:generate`: This command inspects your schema file (`lib/drizzle/schema.ts`) and generates SQL migration files in the `lib/drizzle/migrations` directory. Run this command whenever you change your schema.
-   `pnpm db:push`: This command applies any pending migrations to your database, updating its schema to match your application's schema.

### Supabase (Postgres) Setup

If you are using Supabase Postgres, SSL/TLS is required. This project enforces SSL at the client level and expects a valid connection string in your environment.

- Environment variable: set `DATABASE_URL` with `sslmode=require`.
  - Pooled (recommended): `postgresql://USER:PASS@YOUR_PROJECT_ID.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?sslmode=require`
  - Direct: `postgresql://USER:PASS@YOUR_PROJECT_ID.supabase.co:5432/postgres?sslmode=require`
- Client config: `lib/drizzle/index.ts` forces SSL (`ssl: 'require'`) and throws if `DATABASE_URL` is missing.

Verification scripts (safe):

- `pnpm db:check`: checks connectivity with `SELECT 1`.
- `pnpm db:test-insert`: creates the `users` table if missing, inserts/selects a test row, and cleans it up.
- Optional: `pnpm db:seed` to seed example `users`.

Local API test:

1. Run `pnpm dev`.
2. Send a POST to `http://localhost:3000/api/add-user` with:
   `{"fullName":"CLI Test","phone":"555-CLI"}`
3. You should get back the inserted user as JSON.

Troubleshooting:

- Connection errors: ensure `?sslmode=require` is present or verify your credentials/host.
- Table missing: run `pnpm db:test-insert` (creates `users`) or manage via Drizzle migrations (`pnpm db:push`).
- TS path alias: if imports like `@/lib/drizzle` fail, add to `tsconfig.json` under `compilerOptions`: `"paths": { "@/*": ["./*"] }`.
